	abstract = {We present an autoencoder that leverages learned
                  representations to better measure similarities in
                  data space. By combining a variational autoencoder
                  with a generative adversarial network we can use
                  learned feature representations in the GAN
                  discriminator as basis for the VAE reconstruction
                  objective. Thereby, we replace element-wise errors
                  with feature-wise errors to better capture the data
                  distribution while offering invariance towards e.g.
                  translation. We apply our method to images of faces
                  and show that it outperforms VAEs with element-wise
                  similarity measures in terms of visual fidelity.
                  Moreover, we show that the method learns an
                  embedding in which high-level abstract visual
                  features (e.g. wearing glasses) can be modified
                  using simple arithmetic.},
