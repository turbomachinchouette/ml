* Requirements
** Quantitative metrics
- Reconstruction MSE, compare from cVAE
- Compare MSE values with visual quality of reconstruction.

** Qualitative Analysis
- Plot a grid comparing cVAE and GAN and discuss
- Conditioned Generation
- Latent Interpolation
- Style Transfer

** Answer
1. How does the VAE-GAN compare to cVAE in terms of image quality and diversity?
2. What challenges did you face in balancing VAE and GAN objectives
3. How effective is the conditional generation?
4. What is the effect of using deature matching loss?
5. What improvement would you suggest

* Tips
- *Hyperparameters* start with $\gamma = 10^{-6}$.
- Maybe you have to give extra training to the Generator.
- Avoid BatchNorm in the last layer of Gen and first layer of Dis.
